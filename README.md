Implemented Course Recommender Sytem using Django

A course recommender system is a technology that suggests educational courses to individuals based on their preferences, past behavior, and data analysis. It aims to provide personalized recommendations, improve learning outcomes, and help users discover relevant and high-quality courses that match their interests and goals.

This project utilizes Content-Based Filtering for course recommendation. It analyzes the content of courses, such as their descriptions, difficulty levels, and ratings, and recommends similar courses based on those attributes. It helps users discover courses based on their interests and preferences, without relying on collaborative filtering or user feedback.
